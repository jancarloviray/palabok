## About

Flowloop is a productivity timer that helps you maintain a [state of flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). It keeps you aware of time without having to interrupt you.

When using Flowloop, your day will be divided into **laps**. Each lap represents 25 minutes of productive work. This lets you:

- __Schedule work better.__ You'll be able to do around 10 laps in one typical work day. Awareness of laps will help you schedule your time wisely.

- __Motivate yourself.__ By keeping a list of laps over the last week, you'll be giving yourself a subtle push of encouragement to perform as much as yesterday, if not better.

- __Manage distractions.__ By clearly designating time periods as for work and break, it helps you be more productive in your work and enjoy your breaks better.

## How it works

- Every 25 minutes of uninterrupted work time is **1 lap**. A bell sound will be played when you finish a lap.

- The next lap will sound 1 more bell than the last, as long as your work is not interrupted. That is: 1 bell for the first lap, 2 bells for the second, and so on. This keeps you aware of how long you've been working.

- You can take a break any time you wish for as long as you want. Increasing number of bells will also play every 5 minutes to remind you to get back to work.

- Flowloop will keep a list of all your completed laps every day. This lets you see how productive you've been throughout the day and week.

## Comparison with Pomodoro

Flowloop was born out of the frustration of Pomodoro timers all imposing 5-minute distraction breaks just as you're starting to get focused. I prefer a timer that gently reminds me of time spent, rather than one that requires my input 4 times in an hour.

Flowloop is Pomodoro with no limits on work hours or break lengths. You'll be subtly reminded of how long you've been working (or on break), instead of being forced to stop or to start.
